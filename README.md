## Course Exercises: Programming with Dependant Types in Scala

These are solutions to exercises from the [stepik.org](https://stepik.org) course [Introduction to programming with dependent types in Scala](https://stepik.org/course/49181)

### Extracurricular material I used:

- [A Tutorial Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus
](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/)
- [Simple Lambda calculus Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus)
- [Type rules Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_rule)
- [Induction Recursion Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction-recursion)
- [ProvingGround HoTT Notes](http://siddhartha-gadgil.github.io/ProvingGround/notes/HoTT.html)
- [Greek Letters Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_letters_used_in_mathematics,_science,_and_engineering) ;)

### Environment setup notes:

I used the compiled jar copy-paste method illustrated in the [2nd installations video](https://stepik.org/lesson/186361/step/2?unit=160896), however, I had to use a different Jar than described in the video.
